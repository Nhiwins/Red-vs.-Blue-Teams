# Red vs. Blue Team

In this technical cybersecurity project, both red and blue team attributes were utilized. The red team was tasked with exploiting vulnerabilities in a system that was being monitored by a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. The blue team was responsible for detecting and responding to these exploits. Through this process, the system's security posture was evaluated and weaknesses were identified. This allowed for improvements to better protect against future attacks.
